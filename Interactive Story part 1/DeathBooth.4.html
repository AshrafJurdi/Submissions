        "A DAMN burger you say!!!! How dare you say that?!!" and she shot his finger out!!! <br>
        Jon was squeeling like a baby raven. He knew that this could be his end. He held him self back together and grabbed the phone. <br>
        "Yes a burger!" <br>
        "No Jon, it was a Grilled prime Angus beef patty filled with crispy pork bacon, topped with melted cheddar cheese, grilled onions and tomato, mayo and the signature B.B.B. sauce brushed with additional RedHot Sauce during last few minutes of cooking." <br>
        "OMG are you for real? Daenerys please stop this! I am begging you to stop my Lady." <br>
        "I am not a lady Jon, I am a Queen" <br>
        "Queen?! Queen of what?" <br>
        "Oh, so you forget now! maybe I should refresh your memory agin!" <br>
        "Noooo, I remember, please don't shoot. you are the Queen of Burgers!" <br>
        "Good, now you remember Jon!" <br>
        "Daenerys, please let me fix this, give me a chance." <br>
        "Let me think about it."
