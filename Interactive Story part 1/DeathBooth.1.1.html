    <h1>DeathBooth</h1>
    <P>Jon hungup and turned to leave the booth when suddenly a bullet rapids through the air and targets the external door handle of the booth. Jon was in a complete state of shock! not knowing what happened, yet mesmirised by what he experienced. <br>
        "tring tringggg, tring tringgg" the phone rang. <br>
        Jon rushed and picked up the phone. <br>
        "What the fu.. , this is not a game anymore!!!" <br>
        "Relax Jon, everything is a game in life, you just need to know how to play the game! hahahaha" <br>
        "This is not funny!!!!" <br>
        "Shutup Jon, you just answer here."
