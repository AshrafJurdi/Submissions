    <P>Jon was sweating and terified not knowing why or whom is doing this to him. He started thinking about different senarios trying to figure who might be doing this to him. He finally had the courage and asked: <br>
        "Please stop. I will pay you whatever you want, just please stop it." <br>
        "So you think you can buy your way out of everything in life? I see now that you have never changed Jon!" <br>
        "What do you mean? I am realy confused now. Please just tell me at least what's your name." <br>
        "Well I can't tell you my name, but I will tell you what they call me! maybe this will help trigger your memmory" <br>
        "Okay!" <br>
        "I am the first of my name, the rightful foodie of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm, Queen of Burgers, Khaleesi of McDonalds, the Unstuffed, and Mother of Shawarma" <br>
        ":|"
        "So do you know who I am now?"
